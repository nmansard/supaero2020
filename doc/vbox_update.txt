# Packet robotpkg-py35-example-robot-data is needed for TP2
sudo apt install  robotpkg-py3\*-example-robot-data

# Update of robotpkg-example-robot-data:
#   This will be automatically done when installing the previous packet.
#   It is adviced that everybody does the same update so that all OS are similar.
#   This is optional, recommanded but not mandatory.
sudo apt upgrade

# Add a symbolic link to enable back-compatibility with previous robotpkg-example-robot-data
#   Previously, the notebooks were searching for the urdf robot-model files in a directory.
#   The path has been changed by the previous apt upgrade
#   It is recommanded to add a symbolic link to keep the previous path acceptable.
